When talking about acceptance tests we can achieve this kind of clarity by having a 1:1 relationship between the tests and the acceptance criteria for the application. A very effective way to express acceptance criteria is through _job stories_. In this post we'll see how to write acceptance tests that map job stories for our iOS apps, using KIF and Specta.</description><pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 2015 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://mokacoding.com/blog/job-stories-acceptance-tests-with-KIF-and-specta</guid><category>Acceptance Testing</category><category>KIF</category><category>Specta</category></item><item><title>Better tests with Specta</title><description>Writing unit tests for our iOS and OS X projects not only is important, but should be always part of the development cycle.
