_Note: I'm writing this post to store the code related to this approach. Full
credits to [Witold Skibniewski](http://mr-v.github.io/about/) and [Paul Boot](http://qualitycoding.org/app-delegate-for-tests/#comment-61735)
that shared the Swift 2.0 implementation in [Jon Reid](http://qualitycoding.org/)'s
post ["How to Easily Switch Your App Delegate for Testing"](http://qualitycoding.org/app-delegate-for-tests/),
and to Jon for wirting the post that started the conversation._

Here's how to have a dedicated `AppDelegate` for the unit test target in Swift:

```swift
//
// main.swift
//
import UIKit

private func delegateClassName() -> String? {
  return NSClassFromString("XCTestCase") == nil ? NSStringFromClass(AppDelegate) : nil
}

UIApplicationMain(Process.argc, Process.unsafeArgv, nil, delegateClassName())

//
// AppDelegate.swift
//
import UIKit

class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
  // ...
}
```

Note how we have removed the `@UIApplicationMain` annotation from the app
delegate class definition that Xcode generates for us, as that is now
implemented by `main.swift`.

You can [checkout this example](https://github.com/mokacoding/TestAppDelegateExample)
for a full project using this approach.

I really like how leanear and faster the test target is without having to
perform all the initialization code that is done in the normal `AppDelegate`,
and I encourage everyone to adopt this simple approach.

On top of that less thing happening on the Simulator while testing == more confidence in the
results ðŸŽ‰.

_Leave the codebase better than you found it._
